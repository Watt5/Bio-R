This will act as a repository for an assignment involving making an R tutorial.


1. The summary and rtutwrite up are the same but one in the original document to download.
2. The Rtut_jerradwatts.pptx is the prepared presentation for the project.
3. Tutorial code is all the code needed to run the project.
4. All the files with several underscores and ending with a number, ex. PhyllaDub_gbif_1, are the spine outlines to run the code on.
5. The gpht_data_hull is the additional information for the spine samples.
